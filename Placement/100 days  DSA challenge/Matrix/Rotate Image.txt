Rotate Image
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, List: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
     
        for i in range(len(List)):
            for j in range(i,len(List[i])):
                List[i][j],List[j][i]=List[j][i],List[i][j]

            List[i].reverse()
