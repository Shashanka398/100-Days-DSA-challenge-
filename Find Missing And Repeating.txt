Find Missing And Repeating

Link:https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-missing-and-repeating2512/1

Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2,....,N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
Arr[] = {2, 2}
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and 
smallest positive missing number is 1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
Arr[] = {1, 3, 3}
Output: 3 2
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and 
smallest positive missing number is 2.
Solution:
class Solution:
    def findTwoElement( self,arr, n): 
        # code here
        ans=set(arr)
        su=0
        for i in ans:
            su+=i
        wholesum=(n*(n+1))//2
        final=wholesum-su
        dic={}
        repeated=0
        for i in arr:
            dic[i]=dic.get(i,0)+1
        for x,y in dic.items():
            if y>1:
                repeated=x
        li=[]
        li.append(repeated)
        li.append(final)
        return li
