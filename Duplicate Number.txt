287. Find the Duplicate Number
Link:https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3

Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def findDuplicate(self, nums):
        dic={}
        for i in nums:
            dic[i]=dic.get(i,0)+1
        ans=0
        for x,y in dic.items():
            if y>1:
                ans=x
        
        return ans
        """

        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
