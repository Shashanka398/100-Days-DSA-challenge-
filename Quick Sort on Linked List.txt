Solution:
    #return head after sorting
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    p = head

    shead = small = Node(-1)
    lhead = large = Node(-1)
    curr = head.next
    while curr:
        if curr == p:
            curr = curr.next
        elif curr.data < p.data:
            small.next = curr
            curr = curr.next
            small = small.next
        else:
            large.next = curr
            curr = curr.next
            large = large.next
    
    small.next = None
    large.next = None
    
    small = quickSort(shead.next)
    p.next = None
    large = quickSort(lhead.next)
    
    temp = small
    while temp and temp.next:
        temp = temp.next
    if temp:
        temp.next = p
    else:
        small = p
