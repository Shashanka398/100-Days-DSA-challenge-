Minimize the Heights II
Link:https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimize-the-heights3351/1

Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.


Example 1:

Input:
K = 2, N = 4
Arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
Output:
5
Explanation:
The array can be modified as 
{3, 3, 6, 8}. The difference between 
the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.

class Solution:
    def getMinDiff(self, nums, length, k):
        # code here
        nums.sort()
        ans=nums[length-1]-nums[0]
        largest=max(nums)-k
        smallest=min(nums)+k
        for i in range(0,len(nums)-1):
            temin=min(smallest,nums[i+1]-k)
            temax=max(largest, nums[i]+k)
            if temin<0:
                continue
            ans=min(ans,temax-temin)
        
        return ans
