Smallest subarray with sum greater than x

Link:https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/smallest-subarray-with-sum-greater-than-x5651/1

Given an array of integers (A[])  and a number x, find the smallest subarray with sum greater than the given value. If such a subarray do not exist return 0 in that case.

Note: The answer always exists. It is guaranteed that x doesn't exceed the summation of a[i] (from 1 to N).

Example 1:

Input:
A[] = {1, 4, 45, 6, 0, 19}
x  =  51
Output: 3
Explanation:
Minimum length subarray is 
{4, 45, 6}
