Majority Element
Link:https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/majority-element-1587115620/1

Given an array A of N elements. Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array A of size N is an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array.
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3 
A[] = {1,2,3} 
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Since, each element in 
{1,2,3} appears only once so there 
is no majority element.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, A, N):
        #Your code here
        dic={}
        for i in A:
            dic[i]=dic.get(i,0)+1
        ans=-1
        for x,y in dic.items():
            if y>(N//2):
                ans=x
        return ans
