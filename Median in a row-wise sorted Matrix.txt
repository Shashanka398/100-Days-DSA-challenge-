Median in a row-wise sorted Matrix

Link:https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/median-in-a-row-wise-sorted-matrix1527/1
Given a row wise sorted matrix of size R*C where R and C are always odd, find the median of the matrix.

Example 1:

Input:
R = 3, C = 3
M = [[1, 3, 5], 
     [2, 6, 9], 
     [3, 6, 9]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Sorting matrix elements gives 
us {1,2,3,3,5,6,6,9,9}. Hence, 5 is media

Soution:
import statistics
class Solution:
    def median(self, matrix, R, C):
        l=[]
        for i in range(R):
            for j in range(C):
                l.append(matrix[i][j])
        return int(statistics.median(l))
