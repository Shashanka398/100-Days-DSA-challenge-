Given an array arr[] of distinct integers of size N and a value sum, the task is to find the count of triplets (i, j, k), having (i<j<k) with the sum of (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]) smaller than the given value sum.


Example 1:


Input: N = 4, sum = 2
arr[] = {-2, 0, 1, 3}
Output:  2
Explanation: Below are triplets with 
sum less than 2 (-2, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 3). 

Solution:
class Solution:
    def countTriplets(self, arr, n, sumo):
        #code here
        arr.sort()
        c=0
        for k in range (n-2):
            i=k+1
            j=n-1
            while i<j:
                val=arr[k]+arr[i]+arr[j]
                if val<sumo:
                    c+=(j-i)
                    i+=1
                else:
                    j-=1
        return c
