Unique Number of Occurrences
Link:https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/description/
Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        dic={}
        for i in range(len(arr)-1,-1,-1):

            print(arr[i],end=" ")
        for i in arr:
            dic[i]=dic.get(i,0)+1
        ans=list(dic.values())
        ans1=set(ans)
        if len(ans)==len(ans1):
            return 1
        return 0
