Check if strings are rotations of each other or not

Link:https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-strings-are-rotations-of-each-other-or-not-1587115620/1

Given two strings s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1. The characters in the strings are in lowercase.

 

Example 1:

Input:
geeksforgeeks
forgeeksgeeks
Output: 
1
Explanation: s1 is geeksforgeeks, s2 is
forgeeksgeeks. Clearly, s2 is a rotated
version of s1 as s2 can be obtained by
left-rotating s1 by 5 units.


Solution:
class Solution:
    
    #Function to check if two strings are rotations of each other or not.
    def areRotations(self,s1,s2):
        #code here
        if len(s1)!=len(s2):
            return 0
        s3=s1+s1
        i=0
        if s2 in s3:
            return 1
        else:
            return 0
